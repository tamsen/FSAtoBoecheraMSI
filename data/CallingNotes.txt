notes:	
BF11, only call bumps to the right ~95 if we see a nice descending order
BF20, never call the bump at 204 that comes before 209, or at 212 that comes before 218 etc. Always go with the leading peak - there is usually an echo. call the front peak
BF9, a true polyploid is a real mess. A dipoid has two peaks with a small echo. Call the front peak
